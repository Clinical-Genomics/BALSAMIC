Target Genome Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BALSAMIC :superscript:`1` (**version** = 15.0.1) was used to analyze the data from raw FASTQ files.
We first quality controlled FASTQ files using FastQC v0.11.9 :superscript:`2`.
Adapter sequences are trimmed using fastp v0.23.2 :superscript:`3` and then UMI sequences are extracted using the UMI extract tool from sentieon-tools 202308.03 :superscript:`15` and finally low-quality bases were trimmed using fastp v0.23.2 :superscript:`3`.
Trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome hg19 using sentieon-tools 202308.03 :superscript:`15`.
The resulting BAM is quality controlled using samtools v1.15.1 :superscript:`26`, and AlignmentStat, InsertSizeMetricAlgo, GCBias, MeanQualityByCycle, QualDistribution and BaseDistributionByCycle from sentieon-tools 202308.03 :superscript:`15`.
Duplicate reads are collapsed using the UMI function in Dedup from sentieon-tools 202308.03 :superscript:`15`, and invalid mates are corrected with tools collate and fixmate from samtools v1.15.1 :superscript:`26`.
Coverage metrics are collected from the final BAM using Sambamba v0.8.2 :superscript:`27`, Mosdepth v0.3.3 :superscript:`28` and CollectHsMetrics from Picard tools v2.27.1 :superscript:`6`.
Results of the quality controlled steps were summarized by MultiQC v1.22.3 :superscript:`7`.
Small somatic mutations (SNVs and INDELs) were called for each sample using VarDict 2019.06.04 :superscript:`8` and filtered using the criteria (*MQ >= 30, DP >= 100 (20 for exome-samples), VD >= 5, Minimum AF >= 0.007, Maximum AF < 1, GNOMADAF_popmax <= 0.005, swegen AF < 0.01*).
Only those variants that fulfilled the filtering criteria and scored as `PASS` in the VCF file were reported.
Structural variants (SV) were called using Manta v1.6.0 :superscript:`9` on a post-processed version of the BAM which was base-quality capped to 70, and Delly v1.0.3 :superscript:`10`.
Copy number variations (CNV) were called using CNVkit v0.9.10 :superscript:`11`.
The variant calls from CNVkit, Manta and Delly were merged using SVDB v2.8.1 :superscript:`12`.
The clinical set of SNV and SV is also annotated and filtered against loqusDB curated frequency of observed variants (frequency < 0.01) from non-cancer cases and only annotated using frequency of observed variants from cancer cases (somatic and germline).
All variants were annotated using Ensembl VEP v104.3 :superscript:`13`. We used vcfanno v0.3.3 :superscript:`14`
to annotate somatic variants for their population allele frequency from gnomAD v2.1.1 :superscript:`18`, CADD v1.6 :superscript:`24`, SweGen :superscript:`22` and frequency of observed variants in normal samples. The MSI (MicroSatellite Instability) score was computed using MSIsensor-pro v1.2.0 :superscript:`25`.

Whole Genome Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BALSAMIC :superscript:`1` (**version** = 15.0.1) was used to analyze the data from raw FASTQ files.
We first quality controlled FASTQ files using FastQC v0.11.9 :superscript:`2`.
Adapter sequences and low-quality bases were trimmed using fastp v0.23.2 :superscript:`3`.
Trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome hg19 using sentieon-tools 202308.03 :superscript:`15`.
Duplicated reads were marked using Dedup from sentieon-tools 202308.03 :superscript:`15`.
The BAM file was then realigned using Realign from sentieon-tools 202308.03 :superscript:`15` and common population InDels.
The final BAM is quality controlled using WgsMetricsAlgo, CoverageMetrics, AlignmentStat, InsertSizeMetricAlgo, GCBias, MeanQualityByCycle, QualDistribution and BaseDistributionByCycle from sentieon-tools 202308.03 :superscript:`15`, and CollectWgsMetrics and CollectHsMetrics functionalities from Picard tools v2.27.1 :superscript:`6`.
Results of the quality controlled steps were summarized by MultiQC v1.22.3 :superscript:`7`.
Small somatic mutations (SNVs and INDELs) were called for each sample using Sentieon TNscope :superscript:`16`.
The called-variants were also further second filtered using the criteria (DP(tumor,normal) >= 10; AD(tumor) >= 3; AF(tumor) >= 0.05, Maximum AF(tumor < 1;  GNOMADAF_popmax <= 0.001; normalized base quality scores >= 20, read_counts of alt,ref alle > 0).
Structural variants were called using Manta v1.6.0 :superscript:`9`, Delly v1.0.3 :superscript:`10` and TIDDIT v3.3.2 :superscript:`12`.
Copy number variations (CNV) were called using ascatNgs v4.5.0 :superscript:`17` (tumor-normal), Delly v1.0.3 :superscript:`10` and CNVpytor v1.3.1 :superscript:`22` (tumor-only) and converted from CNV to deletions (DEL) and duplications (DUP).
The structural variant (SV) calls from Manta, Delly, TIDDIT, ascatNgs (tumor-normal) and CNVpytor (tumor-only) were merged using SVDB v2.8.1 :superscript:`12`
The clinical set of SNV and SV is also annotated and filtered against loqusDB curated frequency of observed variants (frequency < 0.01) from non-cancer cases and only annotated using frequency of observed variants from cancer cases (somatic and germline).
All variants were annotated using Ensembl VEP v104.3 :superscript:`13`. We used vcfanno v0.3.3 :superscript:`14`
to annotate somatic single nucleotide variants for their population allele frequency from gnomAD v2.1.1 :superscript:`18`, CADD v1.6 :superscript:`24`, SweGen :superscript:`22`  and frequency of observed variants in normal samples. The MSI (MicroSatellite Instability) score was computed using MSIsensor-pro v1.2.0 :superscript:`25`.

UMI workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BALSAMIC :superscript:`1` (**version** = 15.0.1) was used to analyze the data from raw FASTQ files.
We first quality controlled FASTQ files using FastQC v0.11.9 :superscript:`2`.
Adapter sequences were trimmed using fastp v0.23.2 :superscript:`3`.
UMI tag extraction and alignment and consensus-calling of UMI groups were performed using Sentieon tools 202308.03 :superscript:`15`.
Consensus reads were filtered based on a minimum reads `3,1,1`. supporting each UMI tag group, meaning that at least 3 read-pairs with at least 1 from each strand is required for each UMI-group.
The filtered consensus reads were quality controlled using Picard CollectHsMetrics v2.27.1 :superscript:`5`. Results of the quality controlled steps were summarized by MultiQC v1.22.3 :superscript:`6`.
For each sample, somatic mutations were called using Sentieon TNscope :superscript:`16`, with non-default parameters for passing the final list of variants
(--min_tumor_allele_frac 0.0005, --filter_t_alt_frac 0.0005, --min_init_tumor_lod 0.5, min_tumor_lod 4, --max_error_per_read 5  --pcr_indel_model NONE, GNOMADAF_popmax <= 0.02).
The clinical sets of SNV and SV are also annotated and filtered against loqusDB curated frequency of observed variants (frequency < 0.01) from non-cancer cases and only annotated using frequency of observed variants from cancer cases (somatic and germline).
All variants were annotated using Ensembl VEP v104.3 :superscript:`7`. We used vcfanno v0.3.3 :superscript:`8` to annotate somatic variants for their population allele frequency from gnomAD v2.1.1 :superscript:`18`, CADD v1.6 :superscript:`24`, SweGen :superscript:`22` and frequency of observed variants in normal samples.
For exact parameters used for each software, please refer to  https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/BALSAMIC.
We used three commercially available products from SeraCare [Material numbers: 0710-067110 :superscript:`19`, 0710-067211 :superscript:`20`, 0710-067312 :superscript:`21`] for validating the efficiency of the UMI workflow in identifying 14 mutation sites at known allelic frequencies.
