#         CentOS 7 Build
#
# Downloads and installs the latest
# CentOS 6 build posted to S3 from 
# Jenkins in a CentOS 7 VM.
#
# IP: 10.0.0.68
# Admin dash username: admin
# Admin dash password: password
#
# NOTE that this image uses a custom box. It's based off of the
# minimal CentOS 7 box on vagrantbox.es, but we bumped to guest
# additions to match 4.3.20. On my Ubuntu 14.04 machine, I needed
# 4.3.20 Virtual box on the host machine and this custom image
# on the guest machine to get shared folders to work.
# 
# mostly copied from official shiny_server git repo

  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    # vb.gui = true
  
    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.
